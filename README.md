## Introduction

`hugo-theme-terminal-revived` is a fork of the [hugo-theme-terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) made by Panr. Initially forked for personal purpose, I decided to make it public since the original repo has now been archived.

I have squashed the master branch for easier maintenance. Check the `archive` branch for the original commits.

I currently cannot document and make this fork presentable. However, below are the major changes I made so far for my own site:
- Minimal Homepage Layout
- Minimal List Layout
- Option to hide cover on the post's page
- Better Opengraph and Twitter Card templates
- Tweaked `figure` shortcode
- `hiddenPage` mode to limit page discoverability as much as possible
- ...and several more tweaks and fixes that could be reviewed with commit history

## TODO
- [ ] Add search function
- [ ] Review all existing config params
- [ ] Update example site
- [ ] Remaster collapsible code section if needed. Maybe tailor it for any text.
